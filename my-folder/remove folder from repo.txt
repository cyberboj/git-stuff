go to repo folder:

	cd repoName
	
to remove folder in repo:

	git rm -r folderYouWannaRemove

to check if you have the right url for repo:

	git remote -v

if you're seeing origin and upstream:

	git pull 

idk why you have to pull but if someone understands why, please let me know <3

	git branch --set-upstream-to=origin

finally, to push code:

	git push -u origin
